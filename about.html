<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I’m Manashree Kalhapure, a first-year Robotics & Automation student at AISSMS COE with a passion for technology that makes a difference.
I’m still at the beginning of my journey, but I’m curious and eager to learn whether it’s understanding how automation works, exploring the basics of AI, or improving my coding skills. I’m fascinated by how systems operate, how data flows, and how ideas can turn into things that move, respond, and evolve.
Right now, I’m focused on building my foundation. I love diving into new concepts, getting hands-on with projects, and learning from those who have already walked this path.
I’m open to internship opportunities where I can contribute, ask questions, and grow in real-world settings. If you’re working on something exciting whether it’s a smart project, a creative product, or even just an idea with potential I’d love to connect and learn from your experiences.</p>
